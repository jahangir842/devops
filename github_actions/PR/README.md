### Pull Request Template Configuration

Add the following file to the `.github` directory of your project to ensure that a standardized template is automatically applied whenever a new pull request is created.

The template file is available in the current directory:

➡️ **[`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)**

Once placed in the `.github` folder, GitHub will automatically use it for all new pull requests.
