### **The "Lower Left" Gear (Project Settings)**

**The Question:**
"What is that little gear the lower left used for again?"

**The Core Concept:**
That gear icon opens the **Project Settings**. Think of it as the "Engine Room" or "Control Panel" for the entire project.

* *Crucial Distinction:* The gear at the **Top Right** is for the specific page you are looking at (like Board settings). The gear at the **Bottom Left** is for the **Whole Project**.

**The "What's Inside" (Key Interview Talking Points):**
You don't need to memorize everything, but mention these 3 main areas to sound like an expert:

1. **Permissions:** This is where you add new users (like Brian!) and assign them to groups (e.g., "Contributors" or "Readers").
2. **Project Configuration (Team Configuration):** This is where you define your **Iterations** (Sprint Start/End dates) and **Areas** (Product modules).
3. **Repositories:** This is where you set up **Branch Policies** (rules like "You must have a code review before merging").

**The Interview Script (What to Say):**

> "That gear is the **Project Settings** menu. It is where I configure the global rules for the project.
> I mainly use it for three things:
> 1. Managing **Permissions** and adding new team members.
> 2. Setting up our **Sprint Schedules** (Iterations) in the Project Configuration.
> 3. Configuring **Branch Policies** to protect our main code branch.
> 
> 
> Essentially, the top-right gear configures my *view*, but this bottom-left gear configures the *system*."
