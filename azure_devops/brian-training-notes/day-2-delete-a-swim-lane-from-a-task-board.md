### **Managing Swimlanes**

**The Question:**
"How to delete a swim lane from a task board, and how to add one?"

**The Core Concept:**
Swimlanes are the **horizontal rows** on your board. They are used to separate different classes of work (e.g., an "Expedite" lane for urgent fixes vs. a "Standard" lane for regular work).

* *Important Distinction:* You configure this on the **Kanban Board** (`Boards > Boards`), **NOT** the Sprint Taskboard (which usually just groups by User Story or Person automatically).

**The "How-To" Steps:**

1. Navigate to **Boards** > **Boards**.
2. Click the **Gear Icon** (Configure board settings) near the **Top Right**.
3. Click the **Swimlanes** tab in the settings menu.
4. **To Add:**
* Click **+ New swimlane**.
* Name it (e.g., "Expedite" or "Blocked").
* (Optional) Change the color to make it stand out.
* Click **Save**.


5. **To Delete:**
* Hover over the swimlane name in the list.
* Click the **Trash Can icon** (Remove) on the right side.
* *Note: You usually cannot delete the "Default" lane without assigning a new default first.*



**The Interview Script (What to Say):**

> "I manage swimlanes in the **Board Settings**.
> I go to the **Gear icon** at the top right, select the **Swimlanes** tab, and add a new lane—typically an 'Expedite' lane for urgent production issues.
> To delete one, I use the trash icon in that same menu. I use these lanes to give visual priority to critical work items so the team knows what to pick up first."
