The error **"No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted"** in **Azure DevOps** usually occurs when you try to run a pipeline on **Microsoft-hosted agents** but do not have enough parallel jobs available.  

### **Solutions to Fix the Issue**  

### ✅ **1. Request Free Parallelism (For Public Projects)**
- If your project is **public**, you can request free parallel jobs:
- you can change the project from private to public from → Orgainization Settings → Select Policies → turn on the Allow public projects security policy.
- Now select Project settings > Overview > the Visibility dropdown menu, choose Public or Private, and then Save

1. Go to **Azure DevOps** → Click on your **organization name**  
2. Navigate to **Organization settings** → **Billing**  
3. Under **Pipelines**, look for **"Microsoft-hosted CI/CD"**  
4. Click **Request free parallelism**  
5. Submit the form and wait for approval (usually takes a few hours).

### ✅ **2. Buy Hosted Parallelism (For Private Projects)**
If your project is **private**, you need to purchase additional parallel jobs:  

1. Go to **Organization settings** → **Billing**  
2. Under **Pipelines**, find **"Microsoft-hosted CI/CD"**  
3. Click **"Buy more parallel jobs"**  
4. Follow the steps to purchase additional parallelism.

### ✅ **3. Use a Self-Hosted Agent (Free Alternative)**
Instead of relying on Microsoft-hosted agents, you can **set up a self-hosted agent** on your own server:

#### **📌 Steps to Set Up a Self-Hosted Agent**
1. **Go to** your Azure DevOps **Project** → **Project settings**  
2. Navigate to **Agent pools** → Click **Add Pool** → Name it (`SelfHosted`)  
3. Inside the pool, click **New Agent** → Select **OS (Linux/Windows/Mac)**  
4. Download the agent package and extract it:

   ```bash
   mkdir myagent && cd myagent
   tar zxvf vsts-agent-linux-x64-*.tar.gz
   ```

5. **Configure the agent**:

   ```bash
   ./config.sh --url https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG --agent YOUR_AGENT_NAME --pool SelfHosted --replace --work _work
   ```

6. **Start the agent**:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

7. **Update Your `azure-pipelines.yml`** to use the self-hosted agent:

   ```yaml
   pool:
     name: SelfHosted
   ```

This method **removes the need for Microsoft-hosted agents** and lets you run unlimited jobs.
