## 🔹 Create an Azure DevOps Organization

* Sign in to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) using your Microsoft account (preferably your work account tied to Entra ID).
* Click **New Organization**.
* Provide:

  * **Organization Name** (unique across Azure DevOps).
  * **Region** (choose closest to your users for performance).
* Choose whether the organization will be **public or private** (default is private).
* Click **Continue** → Your ADO organization is created.

## 🔹 Connect ADO Organization to Entra ID

* In Azure DevOps, go to:
  **Organization Settings → Microsoft Entra → Connect directory**.
* Select the **Microsoft Entra ID tenant** you want to connect.
* Review and confirm the connection.
* Once connected:

  * All user authentication will be handled via **Entra ID**.
  * You can invite users from Entra ID instead of Microsoft Accounts.

## 🔹 Manage Users and Permissions

* Go to **Organization Settings → Users**.
* Click **Add users** → Enter Entra ID user email addresses.
* Assign **access level** (Basic, Stakeholder, etc.).
* Assign **project roles** (e.g., Project Contributor, Reader).

## 🔹 Benefits of Connecting to Entra ID

* Centralized **identity and access management** (SSO with Entra ID).
* Ability to enforce **Conditional Access** (MFA, device compliance, etc.).
* Integration with **RBAC and security groups** from Entra ID.
* Easier user lifecycle management (when user leaves org, access revoked automatically).

## 🔹 Allow Public Projects in Organization Settings

* To apply the changes immediately, go to ADO → User Settings (top-right corner) → Permissions → Re-evaluate permissions.
* Go to **Azure DevOps → Organization Settings**.
* Select **Policies**.
* Enable **Allow public projects**. (Still not this option ???)

## 🔹 Make a Project Public
